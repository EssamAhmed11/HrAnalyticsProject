                  High % of employees who take sick leave, can be indication of Covid or just a consedantion, 
                  or may be seasonal deases.”Enable better sanitizations or take special measures”
                  
      - Learn PowerBI basics Through this project. How to do analysis by herself, and also need to upload the data by herself.

## Conclusion of the insights:
    In the last 3 months:
                Employees are preferring to work from home rather than from office.
                Friday is the most day preferred to work from home.
                Monday is the lowest day preferred to work from home.
    
    During seasonal climate changes there is some significant increase in sick leave.
    
   ## Advice can be provide for stakeholder, is to change from full time attendance to hybrid one, 
    so employees can work like 2 office days and 3 working from home.
